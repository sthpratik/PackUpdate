# PackUpdate

PackUpdate is a Python utility designed to help developers manage and update their Node.js project dependencies efficiently. It ensures that package updates are validated through tests and resolves audit issues automatically. The tool prioritizes updating packages to their latest versions, but if issues are detected, it falls back to updating to the "wanted" version.

## Features

- **Update Packages**: Updates Node.js project dependencies to their latest versions if no issues are detected.
- **Fallback to Wanted Version**: If issues arise during testing, updates packages to the "wanted" version instead.
- **Audit Fix**: Automatically resolves audit issues in the project.
- **Validation**: Runs tests to ensure package updates do not introduce breaking changes.

## Prerequisites

- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install packUpdate
```

## Usage

Run the CLI tool to update Node.js project dependencies:

```bash
updatePackages <project_path> [--safe] [--pass=N]
```

### Examples

- Basic Update:
  ```bash
  updatePackages /path/to/project
  ```

- Safe Mode:
  ```bash
  updatePackages /path/to/project --safe
  ```

- Multiple Passes:
  ```bash
  updatePackages /path/to/project --pass=3
  ```

- Safe Mode with Multiple Passes:
  ```bash
  updatePackages /path/to/project --safe --pass=3
  ```

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PackUpdate
```

Install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Update Process

To update the packages in your Node.js project, use the following command:

```bash
python updatePackages.py <project_path> [--safe] [--pass=N]
```

### 2. Available Commands and Options

- `<project_path>`: **(Required)** The path to the Node.js project directory containing `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

- `--safe`: **(Optional)** Enables safe mode. In this mode:
  - The script first attempts to update packages to their latest versions.
  - If tests fail, it reverts to the "wanted" version.
  - If tests fail again, it reverts to the current version.

- `--pass=N`: **(Optional)** Specifies the number of passes to attempt updating packages. Default is 1.

### 3. Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Update
Run the script to update packages in a project located at `/path/to/project`:
```bash
python updatePackages.py /path/to/project
```

#### Example 2: Safe Mode
Run the script in safe mode to ensure updates are validated with tests:
```bash
python updatePackages.py /path/to/project --safe
```

#### Example 3: Multiple Passes
Run the script with 3 passes to attempt updates multiple times:
```bash
python updatePackages.py /path/to/project --pass=3
```

#### Example 4: Safe Mode with Multiple Passes
Combine safe mode and multiple passes:
```bash
python updatePackages.py /path/to/project --safe --pass=3
```

### 4. How It Works

1. **Dependency Update**:
   - The script identifies outdated packages using `npm outdated`.
   - It attempts to update each package to the latest version or the "wanted" version based on the mode.

2. **Audit Fix**:
   - After updating dependencies, the script runs `npm audit fix` to resolve any security vulnerabilities.

3. **Validation**:
   - The script runs your project's test suite (`npm test`) to ensure that the updates do not break functionality.

4. **Build**:
   - After updates, the script runs `npm run build` to ensure the project builds successfully.

### 5. Logs and Output

- The script provides detailed logs during the update process, indicating:
  - Which packages were updated successfully.
  - Which packages were reverted to the "wanted" or current version due to issues.
  - Audit issues that were resolved.

### 6. Rollback

If you encounter issues after running the script, you can manually revert to a previous state using your version control system (e.g., Git).

## Example Workflow

1. Ensure your project has a valid `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python updatePackages.py /path/to/project --safe --pass=2
   ```
3. Review the logs to confirm updates and audit fixes.
4. Run your application to verify everything works as expected.

## Publishing to PyPI

To publish the `PackUpdate` package to PyPI, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Tools**:
   Ensure you have `setuptools`, `wheel`, and `twine` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install setuptools wheel twine
   ```

2. **Build the Package**:
   Run the following command to create the distribution files:
   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

   This will generate the `dist/` directory containing the `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files.

3. **Upload to PyPI**:
   Use `twine` to upload the package to PyPI:
   ```bash
   twine upload dist/*
   ```

4. **Authenticate**:
   Enter your PyPI username and password when prompted.

5. **Verify the Upload**:
   Visit [https://pypi.org/project/PackUpdate/](https://pypi.org/project/PackUpdate/) to confirm the package is live.

### Notes:
- Ensure your `setup.py` file is correctly configured with metadata like `name`, `version`, `author`, etc.
- If you are testing the upload, use the Test PyPI repository:
  ```bash
  twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
  ```
